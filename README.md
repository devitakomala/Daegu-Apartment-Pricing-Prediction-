### Daegu Apartment Pricing Prediction

**Background**

Apartments serve as a crucial solution to the housing needs of modern society, given the limited residential land and dense business activities in urban areas. Understanding the dynamics of apartment prices influenced by various internal and external factors is essential.

Individuals and companies often make apartment offers, determining prices on platforms. However, adjusting to market prices poses challenges for apartment owners. Pricing too high may hinder sales, while pricing too low can limit profit potential.

**Problem Statement**

This project aims to conduct predictive analysis using machine learning to assist developers (individuals or companies) in determining optimal apartment prices. Key factors, such as apartment type, nearby facilities, size, and price, will be considered to build a model that accurately predicts apartment prices.

**Urgency**

Rapid economic development in South Korea has heightened housing needs, making it a critical concern. Daegu, being impacted by South Korea's swift progress, requires effective solutions to address housing challenges.

**Purpose**

Optimal Pricing: Determine the pricing strategy that maximizes profit and minimizes loss for apartment owners.

Feature Analysis: Analyze which features have the strongest correlation with sales prices, optimizing predictions for average apartment prices to maximize sales and profit.

**Metric Evaluation**

Evaluation metrics for this project include:

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Represents the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Computes the average percentage differences generated by the regression model.
Smaller values of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE indicate higher accuracy in predicting rental prices based on the selected features.
